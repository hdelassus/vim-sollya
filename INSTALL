# Installing #

Just run `make` or copy the directories ftdetect and syntax into your Vim
directory. By default it is $(HOME)/.vim/


# Usage #

Every source file with the extension .sollya should be recognized automatically
by Vim. To use with other extensions, on a per-file basis, type the command
:setlocal filetype=sollya
To make it permanent for other extensions, modify and add the extension to the
file $(VIMDIR)/ftdetect/sollya.vim
